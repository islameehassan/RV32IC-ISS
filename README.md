## Introduction
<font size = "12">
Welcome to the RV32IC-ISS GitHub repository! This project aims to provide a powerful and efficient solution for converting machine code into RISC-V assembly instructions. The disassembler takes raw machine code as input and produces the corresponding assembly instructions, allowing developers to analyze and understand low-level code.
  
## Project Features
<font size = "12">
The Disassembler project provides the following key features:

Machine Code to Assembly Conversion: The core functionality of this disassembler is its ability to convert machine code instructions into their corresponding RISC-V assembly instructions. It performs a thorough analysis of the binary code, decoding it and producing human-readable assembly output, then prints it into the compiler.

Execute Machine Code: In addition to converting machine code to assembly, this code executes the machine code directly.

Extensibility: The project is built with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add support for additional machine code formats and customizations. Whether you want to incorporate new instruction sets or enhance the disassembler's functionality, you'll find a modular architecture that simplifies the process. For example, there are functions to extract operation code, set the register value, and load it.

## Input Format
<font size = "12">
The input of the disassembler program is the machine code that you want to convert into RISC-V assembly instructions. Machine code consists of binary instructions that are directly executable by the computer's hardware. The disassembler takes this machine code as input and performs the necessary decoding and analysis to convert it into human-readable assembly instructions.
The following is a list of instruction formats:
